ABSTRACT\smallskip

\noindent
  Observability and reachability are important concepts for formal software
  development. While observability concepts are used to specify the
  required observable behavior of a program or system, reachability
  concepts are used to describe the underlying data in terms of datatype
  constructors. In this paper we first reconsider the
  observational logic institution which provides a logical framework for
  dealing with observability. Then we develop in a completely analogous way
  the constructor-based logic institution which formalizes a novel
  treatment of reachability. Both institutions are tailored to capture the
  semantically correct realizations of a specification from either the
  observational or the reachability point of view. We show that there is a
  methodological and even formal duality between both frameworks. In
  particular, we establish a correspondence between observer operations and
  datatype constructors, observational and constructor-based algebras,
  fully abstract and reachable algebras, and observational and inductive
  consequences of specifications. The formal duality between the
  observability and reachability concepts is established in a
  category-theoretic setting.
