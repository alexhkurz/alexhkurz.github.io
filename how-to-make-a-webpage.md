## How to set up a simple webpage
Follow the [instructions at GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).

Add an `index.md` (or `index.html`) file to the repo.

Paste `https://username.github.io` into your browser. 

That's it.

**Troubleshooting:** First time I did this, it worked without any problems. When I set up one for my son, we run into troubles. It tried everything described at [My new Github page isn't showing up](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20895543/my-new-github-page-isnt-showing-up). What helped was to

1. set the repo public,
2. choose one of the available themes,
3. delete the `_config.yaml` file (if one wants to get rid of the theme).

2 and 3 cancel each other out. I have no idea why it was necessary to insert these steps.

**Fancy stuff:** Currently, I am not using anything else than [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) written in the editor [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which has a good git integration. (This is the first time that I am convinced by a microsoft product.)

In case I need something more fancy in the future I intend to collect here some links here that may be good starting points for further developments.
