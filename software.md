# Software

## Programming with AI

The advent of AI pair programming made software development much easier. In each case, the core of the projects below has been developed in less than half a day. [^features] I am grateful to my former student Chris Kruki who contributed to some of the projects and taught me a lot about client-server software development.

[^features]: Of course, it is irresistible to keep tinkering after that. Anyway, no attempt has been made to develop these projects into polished products. In fact, I did want to keep the projects small with plenty of room for future improvements and devlopments. On the other hand, as far as I know, the software is fully functional for what it was intended to do.

The purpose of the projects below is the following. First, to explore research questions about the **applications of LLMs to software engineering**. Second, to build bespoke tools that can be used in the class room for **teaching mathematics and theoretical computer science** via puzzles and computer games. Third, to create seeds that can be used for **teaching the development of free and open source software (FOSS) projects**. Finally, my aim is to integrate all of these elements in such a way that enables the seamless transition from theory to practical software tools within a single semester's time frame.[^tcs]

[^tcs]: While it has always been known that implementing TCS is a great way to learn and understand the concepts, the time it took to actually do this had the consequence that most TCS courses have been taught, like math courses, "pen-and-paper". In some cases, it was possible to teach a theory course based on tools such as interactive proof assistants. I believe that now teachers and students will be able to develop together bespoke tools taylored to the needs of a particular class.

- [SlidingPuzzle](https://alexhkurz.github.io/SlidingPuzzle/): Which invariant characterises the solvable sliding puzzles? 
- [BlocklyLambda](https://alexhkurz.github.io/BlocklyLambdaCalculus/lc-with-definitions/): A compiler (running in the browser) from a block based lambda calculus to JavaScript. 
- [BlocklyPrisonersDilemma](https://github.com/alexhkurz/BlocklyPrisonersDilemma): Create a strategy and play an iterated prisoners dilemma against an opponent on the internet.
- [WikipediaGame](https://github.com/alexhkurz/WikipediaGame): Find the shortest path between two Wikipedia pages: A bare-bones client/server solution.
- [DistributedGraphGame](https://codeberg.org/alexhkurz/DistributedGraphGame).

As an interface to LLMs I use [Aider](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html), see here for some [instructions](https://codeberg.org/alexhkurz/blockly-experiments/src/branch/main/README.md).

## Teaching Programming Languages

In my course on Programming Languages we build interpreters for small programming languages based on lambda calculus. I plan to make more links available here.
