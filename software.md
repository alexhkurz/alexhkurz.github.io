# Software

The purpose of the projects below is to build bespoke tools that can be used in the class room for **teaching mathematics and theoretical computer science** via puzzles and games as well as to create seeds that can be used for **teaching the development of free and open source software (FOSS) projects**. 

**Remark on LLMs**: While it has always been known that implementing theoretical computer science (TCS) is a great way to learn and understand the concepts, before the advent of LLMs most TCS courses were taught "pen-and-paper". I expect that teaching theory together with implementations will become more and more common now.

- [SlidingPuzzle](https://alexhkurz.github.io/SlidingPuzzle/): Which invariant characterises the solvable sliding puzzles? 
- [BlocklyLambda](https://alexhkurz.github.io/BlocklyLambdaCalculus/lc-with-definitions/): A compiler (running in the browser) from a block based lambda calculus to JavaScript. 
- [BlocklyPrisonersDilemma](https://github.com/alexhkurz/BlocklyPrisonersDilemma): Create a strategy and play an iterated prisoners dilemma against an opponent on the internet.
- [WikipediaGame](https://github.com/alexhkurz/WikipediaGame): Find the shortest path between two Wikipedia pages: A bare-bones client/server solution that could sever as a springboard for various class projects.
- [DistributedGraphGame](https://codeberg.org/alexhkurz/DistributedGraphGame).

As an interface to LLMs I use [Aider](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## Teaching Programming Languages

In my course on Programming Languages we build interpreters for small programming languages based on lambda calculus. I plan to make more links available here.
