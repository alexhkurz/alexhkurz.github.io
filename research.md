# Research

(under construction)

My main research interests are in logic, category theory and computer science.

I collected some notes on what [logic in computer science](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SyhGOHYhK) is about.

I plan to add more on category theory and to expand the [list of research topics](research-topics.html) I have been pursuing.

Here are some notes I wrote for [undergraduate research projects](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SyhGOHYhK).
