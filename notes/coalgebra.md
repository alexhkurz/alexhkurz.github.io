One of my favourite topics in mathematics is the duality of algebra and coalgebra. Moreover, in some sense, coalgebra is as fundamental to the understanding of computation as algebra. We all heard something about algebra. But what is co-algebra? And in what sense it is dual to algebra? 

Coalgebra is usually not taught at undergraduate level, but it could be. 

Part I: Introduction

What is algebra? 
- counting, computation with numbers, different number systems, solving equations containing exactly one variable, (I think of a number ... what is it?)
- the same variable appearing more than once ... or two variables ...
- descartes and geometry
Summarise: computation, solving equations, geometry
Examples: High-school algebra, algebra, linear algebra, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, Boolean algebra, relational algebra, universal algebra, algebraic logic, computer algebra, process algebra, ...

What is an algebra?
- a set with operations obeying some equations

What is (the meaning of) symbolic computation?
- termalgebra as the bridge between syntax and semantics
- arithmetic: formal language and a semantics of the formal language

Question: are automata algebras or coalgebras? Can I discuss this without talking about functors and categories? Effects? Monads?

Part III: Logic
