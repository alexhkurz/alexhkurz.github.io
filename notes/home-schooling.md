# Home schooling

(this is in need of an update ... no time right now ...)
  
Our family of 5 has been home-schooling for 18 years (that is the age of our oldest one). We are asked a lot these days about home-schooling. Here are some personal experiences.

There is a beautiful German term for home-education: we are **Freilerner**, "free learners". Unfortunately, it does not translate well to English. [^unfortunately] In England, home-schooling is also called **education otherwise**, a nice term borrowed from [a legal text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Otherwise).

Can we summarize our approach to home schooling in a sentence? Here is one from each of us:

- "Just do what you do on weekends anyway." [^weekends]
- "I was surprised that at school socialising is penalised."
- "The world is your classroom." 
- "There is so much to learn, we don't have time for school."
- "Homeschooling is a journey, you grow with it."

If you are forced to homeschool now, don't try to imitate school. Try to break free in the millions of ways that are possible today. [^outside] 

- Joy is the best teacher.
- Look for the good.
- Compare yourself only with yourself.
- Don't stick to a curriculum, follow your interests.

Following your interests is important, because learning is so much faster if you are motivated and ready to learn.

Planning is difficult. If you really need to plan: Everything takes at least 2 as long you plan for. Even if you take this rule into account. So every plan needs to contain at least 50% unplanned time.

Learning can be difficult. For us, homeschooling does not mean to (always) take the path of least resistance. Sometimes the pain and the resistance can be a measure of the value of what one is learning.

Screen time: The parents and the two younger ones always have to negotiate the rules that are meant to ensure that not  too much time is spent in front of the screen. An hour per day max is what the parents want. But that does not inlude the time spent working. So there are no sharp boundaries.

## The two ideas of homeschooling

There are two extreme ways of homeschooling. Finding your own way in between is part of the adventure of home schooling.

- The first idea is doing school at home, with curricula, lessons, exams, etc.    

- The other one is to create an environment in which  children (and adults) learn by themselves because they want to learn, without set curricula, etc. Often called unschooling. See also the book by John Holt.

## Some of the things we do now

We love home-schooling, but we are not ideological about it. All children are different. Our second one went to school for Year 7 (in the UK), but then decided that he would prefer to continue with home education ... despite loving so much to play football with his mates in the breaks.

We have external teachers for violin, piano, martial arts, arts and crafts, Spanish and (for a long time but not any more) Science. We always chose these classes for the good teachers we knew, not to satisfy curriculum needs imposed on us by others. 

I just list a few things we do now, there has been much more over the years ...

#### Maths

For **maths** we also mix the two approaches, using Khan academy for the curriculum and the skill drill and using other material for creative problem solving.

##### (12 years old) 
- We love the [Fred series](https://www.lifeoffred.uniquemath.com/). Our youngest one is full of energy and does not like to sit down for academic work. But Fred is "crazy" enough for him to like it. And the series is written by somebody who understands maths the way mathematicians do it, not by somebody who tries to drill the skills and tick the boxes. Fred starts from the beginning for small children and goes all the way up. (Mum is not a mathematician and loves these books ... and so does Dad who is a mathematician.)

- Visnos has some nice maths visualisations, our favourite one is about [fractals](https://www.visnos.com/demos/fractal).
    
##### (15 years old) 

For the middle one, we use the "Art of Problem Solving" series. And while maths is not one of his priorities, he is really growing with it. The series is written by mathematicians who teach maths by *doing maths*. First, there are problems to solve and only then the maths is explained. Ideally, the student discovers the method, learns the maths, by solving problems and the explanations are not even needed anymore. Currently, we do 
     - [Probability and Counting](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/item/intro-counting) and 
     - [Geometry](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/item/intro-geometry). 

   (Dad is a mathematician and loves these books.)

##### (18 years)

We just started to learn **data analysis** and to apply it to coronavirus data. We keep a record of our efforts on learning about [coronavirus with R](https://github.com/alexhkurz/coronavirus-in-R/blob/master/README.md).

In the meanwhile, we also added more maths. For example, what are the real numbers? Why are roots not fractions? Etc

##### More resources

[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lud7sorrxw) has a fantastic online graphic calculator. The linked example is about finding the x-values for which the points of the red curve are closest to the origin (0,0). Students were expected to come up with the formulas for the blue curve (distance to the origin) and the green curve (its derivative). But the online calculator is a great additional learning tool. It increases the understanding of students if they can easily graph these curves.

#### Projects

Otherwise, we try to find projects that are meaningful and "wholesome". Some current examples.

- Our second one wants to be a musician. The basic equipment for a **recording studio** is available for approx $300 plus software (which can be free if you are just starting). There is a lot to learn from this that goes beyond music.

- In times of climate protests children organise **poltical protest** around the world such as FridaysForFuture. They organise events, print flyers, give speeches, etc. Much of it you could book under English, or Economics, or Politics, or Geography ... it wouldnt fit in any curriculum, but they learn much more from this than they could at school. By the way, this can continue online as well ...


- The latest project suggested by our youngest one: Use a  **trail camera** to find find out what wildlife we have in our garden at night. ([Not our garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsDU_tTgsFw&feature=youtu.be)) ... update: the trail camera came today, we are very excited ...

#### Arts and crafts
           
   - Build a trebuchet. Not a [big one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVO8VznqMeQ), just a small prototype.
   - Do an Arduino project, for example, https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/rfid-works-make-arduino-based-rfid-door-lock/ ... we didnt finish it yet, but got to the point where we can control the motor using the RFID.
   - Get a dremel.

### Learning materials

I keep here some favourites as well as a pretty random selection of what come along recently ...

#### Academic

- [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/): 
    - [Maths](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)
    - How does [Pixar](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/effects) make special effects?
    - [Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) in JavaScript
    - ...

- More Maths:

  - I recently found [Jamie York](https://www.jamieyorkpress.com/free-downloads/) because of his wonderful video on [Conic Sections in Clay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djXiL7dTjpw). My son recreated these sections in [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/fusion-360-for-hobbyists), a CAD program that should be freely available on an education licence. This was a nice project that connected maths with real world skills such as CAD. A more advance video on this topic is from [3Blue1Brown
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs), a very good math channel. (Yet another level up then is [Feynman's lost lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU).)

- History:
 
  - [Crash course world history](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9): Always a favourite

  -  [Revolutions](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/): These podcasts give great insights into the history of modernity. I also love his History of Rome podcast.

  - [Mythology, Legend, History in the Bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLtRR9RgFMg&feature=youtu.be). From the youtube feed of the children ... 

- Programming: My daughter and I are creating a [data analysis](https://github.com/alexhkurz/coronavirus-in-R) in R course for high school students with no programming background. Feel free to join.

## Asociations

- [Education Otherwise](https://www.educationotherwise.org/)


## Classic Texts

- [How Children Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Children_Learn) (1967). Few books have influenced home-education more than John Holt's classic.

- [Deschooling Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschooling_Society) (1971). Ivan Illich was Jesuit priest who, around 1970, started to rethink all aspects of society in an unusually original way. Everything he wrote I find deeply interesting, even if often controversial. Not a "How to home-educate?" guide.


## Quotes

Martin Buber (Werke I. Schriften zur Philosophie, S. 1114):

    Ich habe keine Lehre. Ich zeige nur etwas. 
    Ich zeige Wirklichkeit, ich zeige etwas an der Wirklichkeit, was nicht oder zu wenig gesehen worden ist. 
    Ich nehme ihn, der mir zuhört, an der Hand und führe ihn zum Fenster.
    Ich stoße das Fenster auf und zeige hinaus. 
    Ich habe keine Lehre, aber ich führe ein Gespräch.

[^unfortunately]: And even more unfortunately, freilernen is [illegal in Germany](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausunterricht).

[^weekends]: This sentence may not have the same meaning to school-children as it has to homeschoolers: For us, weekends look much more like normal days, whereas weekends for school-children are very special.

[^outside]: Of course, if you cannot go outside and have little children, this may be a really difficult situation. We always spent a lot of time outside when the children were smaller.
