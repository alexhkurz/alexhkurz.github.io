<!-- # Collapse or Flourish? -->


<!-- (2022)
Is our current economic system based on an ecological Ponzi scheme? How will the world look like in 2050 with 10bn people? Will we still be able to provide basic needs (water, food, housing, energy, etc)? If we cannot protect the Amazon rain forest or chimpanzees living in the wild, what are our chances to preserve the natural ecosystems on which our lives depend? Do we need a deep transformation of our society to avoid the collapse of our civilization-supporting natural ecosystems? Will adaptation to global warming and the decline of our ecosystems lead to authoritarianism or can liberal democracies find viable solutions to our global problems? 

What about an economy where the decisions of what to produce are taken democratically by all stakeholders?

(Btw, the recent panel discussion at the University of Oxford on [Degrowth vs Green Growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJrBR0lg6s) features many of these questions.)

<!-- (until August 2023)
Technological progress is becoming so fast that we need scifi to understand the present. A prompt:

Our current economic system is already a superintelligent global AI. The utility function that it maximizes is shareholder value. The hardware it runs on is humans. This superintelligent global AI is a misaligned AI on which we cannot pull the plug. The not-yet-superintelligent tech-AI we have since 2023 will speed up the superintelligent global AI, very much as in the famous paperclip thought experiment. [^moloch]

[^moloch]: See [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) on the Moloch, [Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) on superintelligence (and paperclips) and also this video with [Schmachtenberger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCSsKV5F4xc).

Technological progress in Software Engineering, Distributed Systems and AI is accelerating social, political and economic change at an unprecedented pace. In addition to my theoretical research on the mathematical foundations of computer science (logic, category theory) I am also interested in the impact that software engineering has on society. 

One of the many important question that our civilization faces (which include climate change and biodiversity loss) is the interplay of technology and democracy. Much is being written about democratic decline and how it is related to changing technology. 

<!--
An example of a question in the intersection of technology and democracy is which technologies can contribute to increasing transparency of governments and corporations while protecting citizens from surveillance.
-->

My current working titles for this topic are (most recent last) Democratic Governance, Macrofoundations of Software Engineering, Technology and Culture, Designing Algorithms for Cooperation, Cooperative Systems Science, Cooperative Decision Theory (now we circled back to Democratic Governance). I recently summed up some questions in a lecture [Challenges in Software Engineering](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/r1xJEv9fC).

With the rise of generative AI, all of this also has an AI angle. Here are three questions:
- Can there be a mathematical theory of human behaviour that does not model people as machines?
- Can we define a notion of human intelligence that distinguishes human intelligence from machine intelligence?
- Once we develop machines that show human intelligence, what will distinguish people from machines?

In the following, I list some books that help me to understand the issues. The principles that guide my search for solutions can be summarized by three well-known slogans:  [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) which tells us not be blinded by economic promises of growth and technological promises of higher efficiency, [Gall's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law)[^Gall] which emphasizes the importance of choosing the right direction rather than to hope for revolutionary change, and [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law) which implies that markets alone do not solve problems and that any solution must build on democracy, diversity and inclusion. 

[^Gall]: On page 52 of Gall's book [Systemantics](https://docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/John-Gall---Systemantics_-How-Systems-Work-and-Especially-Ho-8qhgx.pdf). Btw, the book is an interesting mix of satire and valuable enigineering insights.

#### The Alignment Problem (Technology/Society/Ethics)

How does technology drive societal change? How can we align technology (and the economy) to human values? 

- Anna Lembke. **Dopamine Nation**. (2021). How much of our economy is based on addiction?
- Brian Christian. **The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values**. (2020). A history and almost-textbook of machine learning with an emphasis on how to align machine learning with human values. [Author's summary of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzoVn8LUaDs). Is there something to learn about how to align with human values the economy and finance (both increasingly driven by algorithms and AI)? 
- Shoshana Zuboff: **The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power** (2019). Will the information age empower people and democratize knowledge or lead to corporate control of the human experience? Who owns the means of behavioural modification?

How widespread is the use of digital decision making for surveillance and oppression? How can we build technology that can build technology that supports justice? (Btw, intended or not, this book contains a strong argument for universal basic income.) [Interview](https://www.publicbooks.org/public-thinker-virginia-eubanks-on-digital-surveillance-and-people-power/) with the author. 

#### Business

- David Gelles (2022) **The Man Who Broke Capitalism. How Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate Americaâ€”and How to Undo His Legacy**. How was Milton Friedman's shareholder-value economics put into practice?   
- Nick Bilton (2017) **American Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road**. The Ross Ulbricht story is interesting because it has two contrasting narratives. One has Ulbricht as a fighter for free markets and the rights of the individual who was crushed by an all powerful government. The other is that libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion ends in organized crime. Which narrative is more convincing? Which has the greater lessons for our future?
- Parker, Van Alstyne, Choudary (2016) **Platform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy**. See also Alan B Krueger (2019) **Rockonomics: A Backstage Tour of What the Music Industry Can Teach Us about Economics and Life** How platforms change business at the example of the music industry.

#### Collapse and Flourishing

What can the collapse of former civilizations tell us about today? How fragile is our current economic system? How close are our societies (and the natural ecosystems in which they are embedded) to tipping points? In the long run, how do we conceive of a flourishing humanity that lives in balance with the natural ecosystems on which our life depends?

- John Mearsheimer. **The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities**. (2018). Mearsheimer starts out with "There was so much optimism in the early 1990s about Americaâ€™s role in the world. I wanted to figure out what went wrong." He argues that the two strongest forces in geopolitics are nationalism and realism and that even well-intentioned liberalism does more harm than good in foreign politics.

- Jonathan Haidt. **The Righteous Mind** (2012).

#### Democracy, Oligarchy, Political Science

#### Law

In the wake of the murder of George Floyd there has been a fierce debate about systemic racism and how it manifests itself in the economy, in education, the military, police, etc. But what even is the system? In a first approximation, I would say the system is the law. 

- Katharina Pistor. **The Code of Capital** (2019). Is there substance in the often repeated claim that the economy is rigged against ordinary people? How does the law favour some forms of capital over others? What is the role of the law in creating capital in the first place?

#### Philosophy and Ethics

The paradox of market economies (epitomized by the slogan "Greed is Good") is that markets work best if they serve intrinsic values. But what are intrinsic values and how can we agree on them? Even seemingly technical questions (how to account for externalities, which economic activities to include in the GDP, etc) ultimately are ethical questions. There is a widespread feeling that utilitarian ethics is not sufficient, but what are the alternatives? 

- Benjamin Lipscomb. **The Women Are Up to Something: How Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley, and Iris Murdoch Revolutionized Ethics**. (2021).
- Michael Sandel. **What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets** (2012). Do markets distribute scarce resources efficiently only if inequality is limited? Are there values that get corrupted when they are marketized? (What happens to our public town square if likes on Twitter are traded, if the amplification algorithm maximizes advertising revenue, if "grassroot" movements are paid by special interests?)  
- Alasdair MacIntyre. **After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theology**. (1980).  
- Thomas Kuhn (1962) **The Structure of Scientific Revolutions**. Can we learn from Kuhn's notion of paradigm shift to steer our course into the future?
- Aristotle. **Nicomachean Ethics**. (322 BC). Could Aristotle's account of virtue (every virtue balances two vices) be an alternative to the dualism that underpins much of our current world view?

History studies how societies change, a topic that was never more important than today.

- William Dalrymple. **The Anarchy: The East India Company, Corporate Violence, and the Pillage of an Empire** (2019). An early chapter in the history of multinational corporations, colonialism and the stock exchange. Was the EIC an aberration or a blueprint? How do corporate and government power feed each other? (Btw, the American Revolution was in part a revolution against the East India Company.)

- Douglass Rushkoff. **Survival of the Richest**. (2022) [Preview](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/sep/04/super-rich-prepper-bunkers-apocalypse-survival-richest-rushkoff). Have our leaders already accepted that our current economic system will render our world unliveable? Have they given up on technology benefitting human society? Will they be able to solve the insulation equation: earning enough money to insulate themselves from the reality they were creating by earning this money? Or is the best way to prepare for the "Event" to take the very same measures as trying to prevent it?
