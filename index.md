[Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier): *"And so I can't call these things social networks anymore. I call them behavior modification empires. ... I don't believe our species can survive unless we fix this. We cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, the only way that can happen is if it's financed by a third person who wishes to manipulate them."*

"The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future." (2022 IPCC report on climate change)

-->

<!-- The primary problem created by Climate Change is not temperature rise, sea-level rise, or extreme weather. It’s starvation. Without mitigation, around a billion people will starve by the end of this century. Crop productivity is virtually zero when national average temperatures are below -2° or above 25°C and peaks around 15°C. Over the past 60 years, productivity has risen with agri-tech developments, but in the countries near the equator, it is now falling as average temperature increases outweigh further technology gains. In the second half of this century a large band of equatorial countries will neither be able to supply their food nor have the resources to purchase it. [Julian Allwood](https://www.uselessgroup.org/) -->

If we want to survive on this planet, we need to respect [planetary boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries). <!-- and transition to a sustainable economy.--> Are our old ideas about economic growth still viable? What kind of growth[^growth] do we want? Growth (at least naively construed) is not sustainable because sustained growth is exponential growth. (Even a modest [2% per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(real)_per_capita_growth_rate) equals growth of 724% over 100 years and of 1,995,657% over 500 years.) While the [Limits to Growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth) have been recognised for a long time, recent accounts are Dasgupta's Review on [The Economics of Biodiversity](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957291/Dasgupta_Review_-_Full_Report.pdf) and the IPBES Global Assessment Report on [Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://ipbes.net/global-assessment).

[^growth]: For example, I believe that progress in software engineering allows us to argue that exponential growth of knowledge will be sustainable for a long time to come.

In early 2021, the **University of Leicester** threatened with redundancy some of the best mathematicians and computer scientists I know, former colleagues of mine. By the end of the academic year, if I counted correctly, 16 academics in mathematics and computer science either left their job "voluntarily" or were made redundant ... [more](leicester.md).

<!--Both natural and programming languages are recursive. In German also words are recursive, for example, we can make words such [Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderkennzeichnungs-_und_Rindfleischetikettierungs%C3%BCberwachungsaufgaben%C3%BCbertragungsgesetz). There is no longest word in German, much as there is no longest sentence in English. Btw, there is an interesting debate about whether [Piraha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NyB4fIZHeU) is a language in which the length of sentences is also bounded (but the lengths of stories would still be unbounded).

Orange County on Fire:

- [How to build an Air Filter for $30](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-09-17/best-air-filters-sold-out-how-to-make-diy-purifier): We got box fans for $20 from Home Depot and MERV 13 filters are available there and cheaper elsewhere.

Governor Newsome finally finds clear words (Sep 11). Since then we are having wildfires for the third time this season in Orange County. [Pictures](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-03/photos-intense-brush-fire-in-orange-county-prompts-evacuations).

Otherwise, climate change is not really a topic in these elections. Why? There are many reasons: that [Merchants of Doubts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ii9zGFDtc) are undermining the trust in science, that [Our democracy no longer represents the people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE), that the [fossil fuel industry](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1344&bih=660&sxsrf=ALeKk03JjdlENc4XmtLr2MczPAdwVnhCIA%3A1599930745983&ei=eQFdX_3GO8vK-gS1v524CQ&q=site%3Adesmogblog.com%3A+mapping+the+power+of+the+%22fossil+fuel%22+industry&oq=site%3Adesmogblog.com%3A+mapping+the+power+of+the+%22fossil+fuel%22+industry&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1AAWABg5T9oAHAAeACAAUyIAZYBkgEBMpgBAKoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi9552-juTrAhVLpZ4KHbVfB5c4FBDh1QMIDQ&uact=5) dominates politics, that the mainstream media are [biased towards climate change deniers](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1326&bih=916&sxsrf=ALeKk014Kg6rxa9TFTSTewTP110ooTEikQ%3A1599935895689&ei=lxVdX8jPKeit0PEPxMuauAE&q=site%3Adesmogblog.com%3A+%22mainstream%22+media+deny+climate+change&oq=site%3Adesmogblog.com%3A+%22mainstream%22+media+deny+climate+change&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1AAWABgqTBoAHAAeACAAU-IAZkBkgEBMpgBAKoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiI9-bVoeTrAhXoFjQIHcSlBhcQ4dUDCAw&uact=5), the [rise of corporate power](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/221/47211.html). 

But, in fact, [keeping the fossil fuels in the ground](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/news/information/information-detail/article/why-there-is-no-energy-transition-in-many-countries.html) is not enough, what we really should debate is how to achieve a sustainable economy. There are many [new ideas](notes/sustainable-economy.html) ... but I don't hear people talking about it.

The [carbon clock](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html) below shows how much time we have left if we want to limit CO2 in the atmosphere to a value compatible with 1.5, respecticely 2.0, degree Celsius warming compared to pre-industrial levels.

See [climate change with your own eyes](notes/glaciers.html). The longer we wait, the higher the costs. Or is there no action because we have already given up?
