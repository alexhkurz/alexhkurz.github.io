# Decentralizing Governance Lab

(... under construction ...)

The Decentralizing Governance Lab lead by Dr Alexander Kurz is interested in the impact of software on society and culture. Transformational changes are driven by social media, cryptocurrencies and generative AI. 

The lab develops free an open source software (FOSS) projects with two aims in mind. First, to contribute to the study of *technology and culture*, second to create software tools that empower people to participate in collective decision making while preserving individual agency. 

We are working on projects such as decentralized social media, personal AI assistants, decentralized aggregation of information (such as search or data-mining or recommender systems), local-first data storage, decentralized geolocation tracking, trusted AI, etc.

If you are a student interested in this topic (whether your background is in math, computer science, engineering, economics, social science, biology, anthropology, psychology, politics, philosophy, history, etc), feel free to get in touch.
