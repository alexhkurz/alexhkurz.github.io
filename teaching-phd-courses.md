# Graduate teaching

(under construction)

I am always happy to talk about category theory. If you are interested in category theory feel free to get in touch. Here are some notes that I have been using for teaching category theory in the past.

## Recent Notes

In this section, I collect notes that I used more recently and intend to update and maintain.

- [A Very Short Introduction to Monads](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ByD5fgecY).
- A very short introduction to [Category Theory as an Axiomatic Theory of Structure](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BktmSSgCP). This
    - is lecture 3 of a [Short Introduction to Monads](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1OxumxRP) but can be read independently if you ignore some references to the earlier lectures. 
    - also contains a [list of online books with introductions to category theory](https://hackmd.io/JGNOqD4aQHquNcqisW0glA#References-and-Further-Reading).


## Older Notes

In this section I collect notes that may still be usefull as introductions and for background information.

- [Coalgebras and Modal Logic](/papers/cml.pdf). ESSLLI, Helsinki 2001.

- [Slides on Coinduction](/papers/coinduction.pdf).

- [An Introduction to Stone Duality](/papers/stone-duality.pdf). MGS 2004.

- [Topics in Coalgebra](/papers/Copenhagen04/cop04.pdf). Copenhagen 2004.

- [Coalgebras and Their Logics](/papers/lc.pdf). Logic Colummn, 2006. 

- [Modal Logics are Coalgebraic](papers/BCS08/ModalCoalg.pdf) with Cirstea, Pattinson, Schr√∂der, Venema. BCS, 2008.

- [A Short Introduction to Quantale Enriched Categories](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6626b619594908e83eb5ace9). 2020.

I also have notes, from various teaching opportunities that I did not find the time to finish and polish ...  I put some of them here anyway, partly to motivate myself to take them up again when another opportunity arises.

- Incomplete notes on [Introduction to Category Theory](/papers/intro-category-theory.pdf). MGS 2017. Chapter 1 contains a long series of beginner's exercises that should be suitable for self study if you have a mentor who can answer questions.

- An  [Introduction to Coalgebra and Automata Theory](/papers/coalgebras-mgs2018.pdf) in Three Short Lectures and Two Long (unfinished) Appendices. MGS 2018.
