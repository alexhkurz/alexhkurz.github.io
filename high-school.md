# High-School Students

If you are a high-school student who is interested in joining either a software engineering project or to sneak into mathematics research I may have sth for you. 

Btw, if you are wondering, yes, the math side and the software-engineering side are closely related, but that takes more time to explain.

## Mathematics

If you want to learn how to make your own proofs in mathematics from a programming point of view the best starting point is the [Lean Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/) and then the [Lean Intro to Logic](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/trequetrum/lean4game-logic). If that appeals to you, get in touch and I can help you out with tips and background.

If you want to learn more traditional pen and paper mathematics, you can start on the exercises on [Stone Duality](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkRcYBe1o). So far I only had one high-school student who got through this, so don't hesitate to ask for help. It is worth the effort, there is much to learn here.

If you do both the math-as-programming and the pen-and-paper math, you will that while closely related, there is a big gap between the two. To bridge this gap using machine learning tools (such as large language models) is a cutting edge research topic.

## Software Engineering

My interests in software engineering are currently evolving quickly. A recent summary I gave to my students in my Algorithm Analysis course is available [here](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BJXjBaxJC). I am interested in setting up software engineering projects that explore these questions.
