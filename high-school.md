# High-School Students

If you are a high-school student who is interested in joining either a software engineering project or to sneak into mathematics research I may have sth for you. 

If you want to learn how do make your own proofs in mathematics from a programming point of view the best starting point is the [Lean Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/) and then the [Lean Intro to Logic](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/trequetrum/lean4game-logic). If that appeals to you, get in touch and I can help you out with tips and background.

If you want to learn more traditional pen and paper mathematics, you can start on the exercises on [Stone Duality](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkRcYBe1o). So far I only had one high-school student who got through this, so don't hesitate to ask for help. It is worth the effort, there is much to learn here.
